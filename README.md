# Unitics Data Preprocessing, Modeling, and College Major Recommendation

## What is in my project...


## What is in the dataset...

## Result of this project...

## What should I improve next...
1) Try to collect more data from various sources
2) More in-depth observation on the dataset, since there's a lot of outlier.

## My resources...
1) A lot of google searches (geeksforgeeks, kaggle, github, medium articles)
2) Stack Overflow for debugging the problems
3) ChatGPT: I use chatGPT to help me check if my code syntax is correct or not. (In the newer version of the UniticsML improvement. It haven't existed back then in 2021)
