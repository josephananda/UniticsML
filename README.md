- Task: College Major Recommendation System

# Unitics Data Preprocessing, Modeling, and College Major Recommendation
Unitics (University Analytics) is designed to help high school students who would like to pursue higher education in Indonesian state university. Identified problems, such as lack of self-understanding (only following others, not their personal interest or talents and only see trends), lack of relevant information (various majors but no idea which one is suitable), and lack of ability to make decisions become the reasons why this solution is needed.

SNMPTN 2016 and 2017 data from HaloKampus formed a dataset of accepted students' scores at 9 Indonesian state universities. Six subjects trained a Science Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model and seven for a Social MLP model. The models achieved 94.57% accuracy for science (174 majors) and 89.79% accuracy for social (70 majors).

## What is in my project...
This project consists of 4 parts:
1) Data Preprocessing
2) Exploratory Data Analysis
3) Machine Learning Modeling - Multi-Layer Perceptron / Dense Neural Network
4) College Major Prediction and Recommendation

and Machine Learning part is divided into two different model:
1) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Science Major
2) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Social Major

## What is in the dataset...
Selected Attributes:
1) Jurusan Sekolah (School Major): The high school major of the students, "IPA" for Science major and "IPS" for Social major
2)
3)
4)
5)
6)
7)

Non-Selected Attributes:
1) Nama Panggilan (Nickname)
2) Asal Sekolah (School Origin)

## Result of this project...

## What should I improve next...
1) Try to collect more data from various sources
2) More in-depth observation on the dataset, since there's a lot of outlier.

## My resources...
1) A lot of google searches (geeksforgeeks, kaggle, github, medium articles)
2) Stack Overflow for debugging the problems
3) ChatGPT: I use chatGPT to help me check if my code syntax is correct or not. (In the newer version of the UniticsML improvement. It haven't existed back then in 2021)
